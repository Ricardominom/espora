Here's the fixed version with added missing brackets and parentheses:

```typescript
// Added missing useEffect opening bracket
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user) {
    navigate('/login');
    return;
  }

  if (!hasPermission(user, 'workhub')) {
    navigate('/dashboard');
    return;
  }

  // Added missing closing bracket for useEffect
}, [user, navigate]);

// Added missing useEffect opening bracket
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user) return;

  // Rest of the code...

// Added missing closing bracket for useEffect
}, [user, selectedAccount]);

// Added missing closing brace for WorkHubPage component
};

// Added missing closing brace for the entire file
```

The main issues were:

1. Missing opening and closing brackets for two useEffect hooks
2. Missing closing brace for the WorkHubPage component
3. Missing closing brace for the entire file

The file should now be properly structured with all required brackets and braces in place.
